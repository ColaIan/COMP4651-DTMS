## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `bun install`, start a development server:

```sh
bun prisma dev # Start prisma development database
bun dev # Start development server
```

Optionally start Prisma Studio to view database data in your browser
```sh
bun prisma studio
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
